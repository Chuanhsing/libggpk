1. Terms and defintions

* .dat file (*.dat, DAT):
        file with extension 'dat' which contains data that needs to parsed. 
        It contains 0 or more  'records' and data section.

* record: 
        contain 1 or more fields, has the same length as other records

* record field (field):
        part of record, contains data of value or pointer type.

* value type field:
        field contains value in itself. Values can be of type: bool, byte, short, int, long(Int64)

* pointer type filed (pointer field):
        contains offset to data section entry and it's metadata
        

* field id (name): 
        short "name" of field

* field description: 
        explains what data this field contain and how and where it used

* user field: 
        field which reference strings shown to user. Necessary for translating referenced strings

* field type: 
        contains metadata about field type: 
            - name, 
            - width
            - value or pointer
            - and specific delegates for pointer type.

* field's type width:
        number of bytes type (and consequently field) occupies
        values type: 1-8 (from bool and byte to long)
        pointer types:
            4-byte pointer contains just data section offset
            8-byte pointer contains offset and metadata. For example, for list of integers
                           it will contain length of list and offset to first number in the list. 
                           Action on metadata is based on specific pointer field type.

* data section: 
        contains data of variable sizes (strings, lists of integers, etc...). 
        It consists of "magic number" followed by 0 or more data section entries

* data section magic number (magic number): 
        0xBBbbBBbbBBbbBBbb. 
        It marks start of data section and followed by data section entries if they exist.

* data section entry: 
        data that contain some data and referenced by "data section entry offset" 
        in one or more record fields or another data section entries. 
        NOTE: Well, it may be not referenced but it's a waste of space and it possibly couldn't happen.

* data section entry offset: 
        offset from start of data section at which start "data section entry".
        First offet starts equals 8 (after b bytes of "magic word")

* data section types: 
        data section can contain strings, lists of integers and pointers to another data section entry. 
        Possibly it also contain other data. 
        Each type has corresponding derived subclass of AbstractData class.

* string:
        entry of string of length N consists of N UTF-16 charactes (2*N bytes) followed by 
        string terminator (4 bytes: (int)0  ). Final length of string entry equals 2*N+4 bytes.
        If supposedly string type entry doesn't have (int)o at the end it's not a string, 
        if one tries to read extra \0 UTF-16 character it's possible to read beyond stream end and 
        that will lead to thrown exception

 Class Definitions

 * .dat content related classes
 DatContainer - main class, contains all data for parsed .dat
 RecordData - contain list of FielData
 FieldData - contain field data
 
 * .dat format related classes
 RecordInfo - contains record definition
 FieldInfo - contains field information
 RecordFactory - static class responsible for parsing XML and storing record defintions
 
 * data type related classes
 BaseDataType - base class, represents type of simple value
 ListDataType - represents type of list of of the same type data. has property ListData to describe type of list entries
 PointerDataType - represent pointer to another data. has property RefType to desctibe type of referenced data.
 TypeFactory - static class responsible for parsing XML types and creating Data from Type

 * data related classes
 AbstractData - base class
 ValueData - generic class representing simple value data (bool, byte, etc...)
 StringData - ValueData derived class. Handle strings
 PointerData - represents data that contains pointer to another data
 ListData - represents data that contains pointer to another data

 
**** DatContainer *****
Main class for parsing .dat files

It's functions:
- entry point for parsing  .dat files
- store parsed records and data section data
- change data section contents
- save as .csv
- save as .dat

X. How to create new type?
1) create new DataType derived type or use existing
2) create new AbstractData derived class or use existing
3) link them through TypeFactory.CreateData( ... ) method
4) add it's name into type pattern XML schema file (.xsd extension)
